# TikTok
This is a rep made for my app on streamlit
//////////////////////////////////////////
As a first step through the project, I defined the problem and extracted the use cases and according to that, I picked a suitable solution for each part. Then I gathered the latest TikTok dataset from Kaggle and after doing some EDA tasks on raw data, I started to preprocess the data for future steps. After concluding that my task is regression, and also by considering the data format and volume, I picked The Extra tree regressor model (based on my experience working with different models) to train on the dataset.
In the last step, I deployed the web app using the Streamlit on the internet.

* This was my final project for Software Engineering Course at University of Zanjan during the 7th semester
